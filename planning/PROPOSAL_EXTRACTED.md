## Learning Hierarchical Influence Propagation in Organizational Response Systems

**Team:** Hilal Hussain, Mahmoud Abdelmoneum, Theo Chen  
**Date:** October 29, 2025

### Problem Statement

Organizations regularly receive external recommendations—from consultants, regulatory bodies, boards of directors, or internal initiatives—yet their response patterns remain difficult to predict. The challenge lies in understanding how these recommendations propagate through complex organizational hierarchies, where individual agents possess varying degrees of power and influence, operate under partial information, and engage in strategic interactions that affect collective outcomes.

**Core Research Question:** Can deep learning models learn effective representations of organizational dynamics from text descriptions to predict both individual agent responses and collective organizational outcomes, while respecting the game-theoretic properties of hierarchical strategic interaction?

### Proposed Solution

**Framework:** Hierarchical Partially Observable Stochastic Game (H-POSG)

**Components:**
1. **Theoretical Framework:** H-POSG formalization with agents, states, actions, observations, rewards, and authority graph
2. **Deep Learning Architecture:**
   - **Text Encoding Layer:** Dual transformers (recommendation encoder + organizational context encoder)
   - **Graph Propagation Layer:** Graph Attention Network (GAT) for influence modeling
   - **Hierarchical Policy Network:** Agent response prediction with hierarchical conditioning

3. **Learning Objective:** Multi-objective loss = L_pred + λ1*L_consistency + λ2*L_equilibrium

### Technical Architecture

- **Text Encoders:** BERT/RoBERTa-large (768-d embeddings)
- **GNN:** 4-layer multi-head GAT (8 heads, T=3 temporal steps)
- **Policy Network:** MLP with hierarchical conditioning
- **Training:** AdamW optimizer, contrastive learning, multi-agent policy gradients

### Dataset

- **Synthetic:** 10,000 organizations, 75 recommendations each → 750k agent responses
- **Real-World:** 500-1000 cases from business schools, corporate reports
- **ABM:** 100k rule-based simulations for baseline

### Timeline (14 Weeks)

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Infrastructure & Baselines
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Core Model Development
3. **Weeks 5-6:** Scaled Training & Initial Experiments
4. **Weeks 7-8:** Advanced Experiments & Validation
5. **Weeks 9-10:** Finalization & Documentation

### Evaluation

- Predictive Accuracy (individual + organizational)
- Equilibrium Properties (Nash approximation, hierarchical consistency)
- Influence Propagation Fidelity
- Generalization & Robustness
- Interpretability (attention visualization, SHAP)
